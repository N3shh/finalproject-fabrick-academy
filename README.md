# finalproject-fabrick-academy
The purpose of the final project was to validate the skills acquired during the academy. The project involved the development of a SpringBoot component that exposes a series of APIs for demographic and meteorological functions in the Italian territory. 
The component was designed to address the following requirements:

- Retrieve the list of cities with a population greater than a specified value provided as input.
- Return the list of municipalities in a given region with a population greater than a specified value provided as input.
- Return the list of municipalities in a given province with a population greater than a specified value provided as input.
- Return the weather forecast for a specified city provided as input.
- Return the average temperatures over a certain number of days (parameter provided as input) for a specified city (parameter provided as input).
- Given a province and a day, return the average temperatures of all municipalities belonging to that province for that day.

To obtain the necessary data, you were directed to the following links:

- Italian municipalities repository updated to 2018: https://github.com/MatteoHenryChinaski/Comuni-Italiani-2018-Sql-Json-excel/tree/master
It was recommended to download the data, save it, and import it into a database.
